# Turing Machine Simulator
To run compile the **TuringMachine** class, it should get compiled and open the terminal.
Enter the location of of your Turing Machine description and then the input for the tape.

# Input Format
First Line - **ACCEPT STATE**
Subsequent States - Transitions in the format - **(Origin state, Tape Character to be Read, Tape Character to be Written, Shift direction on Tape, Target State)**
You can use some of mine in .tm file I've given.
The machine produces and output for either the input being accepted or rejected(machine halted).

Enjoy writing your Turing Machines! Regards.
